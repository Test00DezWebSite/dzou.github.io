This is a simulator for the iterated prisoners' dilemma game. It is a project for
my game theory class in order to see which strategies are strong in the
iterated prisoners' dilemma game.

How to use:

1. Go into settings and enter in how many instances of each player you want in the game.
2. Run the simulation.
3. Check out the graphs tab on the top nav-bar to see the what the graphs generated.
